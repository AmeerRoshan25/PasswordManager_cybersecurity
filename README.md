# 🔐 Cybersecurity Password Manager
A Secure and Easy-to-Use Password Manager Built with Python & Cryptography
**📌 About the Project**
This Password Manager is a cybersecurity-focused project designed to securely store and retrieve passwords using Python and cryptography. It encrypts stored passwords using Fernet encryption to ensure safety, allowing users to manage their credentials effortlessly.

**🚀 Features**
✅ Secure Password Encryption – Uses the cryptography.fernet module for AES-based encryption.
✅ Store & Retrieve Passwords – Save credentials securely and access them when needed.
✅ Master Key Protection – A master key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
✅ User-Friendly CLI Interface – Simple and easy-to-use terminal-based interface.
✅ Cross-Platform – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
Python – Core programming language

cryptography.fernet – Secure encryption and decryption

JSON – Storage format for encrypted data

**🔧 Installation & Setup**
1️⃣ Clone the repository:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager.git
cd password-manager
2️⃣ Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

sh
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
3️⃣ Install dependencies:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Run the application:

sh
Copy
Edit
python password_manager.py
📸 Screenshots (Optional, Add If Available)
Add screenshots of the command-line interface or any GUI interface if implemented.

💡 How It Works
1️⃣ Generate a Master Key – The system generates a secret encryption key for protecting passwords.
2️⃣ Store Passwords Securely – Each password is encrypted and stored in a local database.
3️⃣ Retrieve Passwords – Users can retrieve passwords by entering their master key.

🛡️ Security Considerations
Strong Encryption – Uses AES encryption via cryptography.fernet.

Master Key Protection – The encryption key is essential for accessing stored credentials.

No Plaintext Storage – Passwords are never stored in plaintext format.
